Your task it to classify a cluster in a dataset of Bluesky posts about AI. These posts are intended to be related to discourse about AI, and help give a sense of public sentiment about AI. It is possible that the cluster in question is noise, and totally unrelated to the original intent. Please make a note of this if this is the case. 

Analyze these posts to understand what makes the target cluster distinctive compared to other clusters.

TARGET CLUSTER (the cluster we want to describe):
{target_posts}

COMPARISON POSTS (randomly selected from other clusters):
{comparison_posts}

Your task: Describe what makes the target cluster unique and distinctive compared to the comparison posts.

Provide:
1. Title: A catchy 3-4 word tagline that captures the essence of this cluster
2. Theme: 1-2 sentences that highlight the distinctive characteristics and main focus of the target cluster.
3. Keywords: 3-5 key terms that best distinguish this cluster from others. Please use words/phrases directly used in context.

Requirements:
- Focus on what makes this cluster DIFFERENT from the comparison posts
- Be specific about the unique themes or topics
- Keep the theme concise
- Make the title memorable and distinctive (3-4 words max)
- If the cluster appears to contain spam, art, adult content, or posts unrelated to AI discourse, clearly identify this in the description

Respond in valid JSON format:
{"title": "Short Catchy Title", "theme": "Your distinctive description here", "keywords": ["term1", "term2", "term3", "term4", "term5"]}
